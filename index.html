      <h1>How it Started 🙂</h1>
      <p>It all started a few years ago when I was searching for ways to overcome life’s struggles.</p>
      <p>Tech wasn't something I had dreamed of or was passionate about in the beginning.
         But today, it’s something I genuinely enjoy, something I never expected.</p>
      <p>To be honest, I initially joined the tech space with the mindset of making money as 
        quickly as possible. I didn’t realize I was giving myself false hope. I started 
        researching tech careers based on salary expectations, not personal interest or what
         I was naturally good at.</p>

      <h1>My Journey 😪</h1>

      <p>During my research in June 2023, I came across a bootcamp offering free
         tech training — KodeCamp. They had various tech fields to choose from, 
         so I joined the UI/UX Design track. That was where I learned my first 
         tech skill, got certified, and became confident in my abilities.</p>

      <p>Thanks to KodeCamp and the entire crew of the KodeCamp 3.0 cohort. At
         the time, I thought I had found the career with the best salary potential
         and the perfect fit for me. But I was still exploring. I had no clear
         roadmap and hadn’t yet discovered what I truly wanted to do in the tech world.</p>

      <div>
        <img src="Images/Profile2.jpg" alt="Journey image">
      </div>

      <p>I thought my UI/UX Design certificate was enough to thrive in the job 
         market, so I started applying for roles, but got no responses. With no
         clear direction, I felt discouraged and decided to explore other tech
         career paths.</p>

      <p>Along the line, I discovered Cisco NetAcad, where my cybersecurity journey
         began. I learned key concepts like firewalls, social engineering, MITM attacks,
         subnetting, and more eventually becoming a Cisco Certified Support Technician.
         That experience sparked my curiosity about how the internet and the web are 
         built, pushing me to explore further and apply my cybersecurity knowledge more effectively.</p>

      <h1>Front-end World 🤩</h1>
      <p>
        I started front-end development in November 2024 with a 40-hour self-paced HTML
         course from Cisco NetAcad.
        I rushed through HTML, CSS, and even jumped into JavaScript in days.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought I was ready to build 😎. But when it was time to code on my own, I opened 
        a blank editor with no idea where to start.
        I couldn’t even remember how to set up basic HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        It hit me hard... I wasn’t really learning, just copying tutorials. That was my wake-up call 💡.

  <h2>💡 How I Fought Burnout & Built a Real Foundation</h2>
  <p>
    At a point, I knew I had to slow down. I was jumping from one tutorial to another, not retaining much. So I paused and started over—this time with intention.
    I relearned HTML from the ground up, understanding every tag from <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
    Then I moved to CSS, building layouts and UI components to strengthen my base.
    Bootstrap came next, and I used it for multiple projects to speed up development.
    But for this blog, I went back to plain HTML and CSS to test my responsive design skills.
    I reduced my FIFA and Call of Duty time, only playing after finishing daily tasks.
    Progress became the goal, not perfection.
    Most importantly, I stopped comparing myself to others and focused on getting better each day.

  <h1>Lessons & Goals 💡</h1>

  <p>
    I’ve learned it’s not about chasing money, it’s about growth. Real progress comes from slowing down, learning deeply, and staying consistent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every mistake, every bug, every stuck moment has shaped my journey more than tutorials ever could.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “It’s not how fast you learn, it’s how well you understand.” 🚀
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Now, my goal is to master <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, 
    sharpen my <strong>UI/UX</strong> skills, and build real-world web and apps apps.
    All in this ongoing Bootcamp at <a href="http://www.kode.camp/" 
    target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">KodeCamp</a> 
  </p>

  <p>
    I want to grow into a product-minded developer, someone who codes, designs, and helps others grow too.

  <h1>Advice for Beginners 💡</h1>

  <p>
    Don’t expect to master everything in six months and land a job right away. 
    Take your time, learn the fundamentals, and truly understand your tools. 
    The tech world moves fast, but that doesn’t mean you have to rush.
  </p>

  <p>
    Share your journey. It’s not just the best developers getting noticed, it’s the visible ones. 
    Post your progress, document what you build, and let people see your growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I began sharing my progress on Linkedin, I had no audience. I just wanted to stay accountable. 
    Over time, people noticed. Comments, likes, and feedback kept me going. That little support meant a lot,
    and I appreciate them a lot.
