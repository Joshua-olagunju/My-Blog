      <h1>How it Started 🙂</h1>
      <p>It all started a few years ago when I was searching for ways to overcome life’s struggles.</p>
      <p>Tech wasn't something I had dreamed of or was passionate about in the beginning.
         But today, it’s something I genuinely enjoy, something I never expected.</p>
      <p>To be honest, I initially joined the tech space with the mindset of making money as 
        quickly as possible. I didn’t realize I was giving myself false hope. I started 
        researching tech careers based on salary expectations, not personal interest or what
         I was naturally good at.</p>

      <h1>My Journey 😪</h1>

      <p>During my research in June 2023, I came across a bootcamp offering free
         tech training — KodeCamp. They had various tech fields to choose from, 
         so I joined the UI/UX Design track. That was where I learned my first 
         tech skill, got certified, and became confident in my abilities.</p>

      <p>Thanks to KodeCamp and the entire crew of the KodeCamp 3.0 cohort. At
         the time, I thought I had found the career with the best salary potential
         and the perfect fit for me. But I was still exploring. I had no clear
          roadmap and hadn’t yet discovered what I truly wanted to do in the tech world.</p>

      <div>

      </div>

      <p>I thought my UI/UX Design certificate was enough to thrive in the job 
        market, so I started applying for roles, but got no responses. With no
         clear direction, I felt discouraged and decided to explore other tech
          career paths.</p>

      <p>Along the line, I discovered Cisco NetAcad, where my cybersecurity journey
         began. I learned key concepts like firewalls, social engineering, MITM attacks,
          subnetting, and more eventually becoming a Cisco Certified Support Technician.
           That experience sparked my curiosity about how the internet and the web are 
        built, pushing me to explore further and apply my cybersecurity knowledge more effectively.</p>

      <h1>Front-end World 🤩</h1>
      <p>
        I started front-end development in November 2024 with a 40-hour self-paced HTML
         course from Cisco NetAcad.
        I rushed through HTML, CSS, and even jumped into JavaScript in days.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought I was ready to build 😎. But when it was time to code on my own, I opened 
        a blank editor with no idea where to start.
        I couldn’t even remember how to set up basic HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        It hit me hard... I wasn’t really learning, just copying tutorials. That was my wake-up call 💡.

  <h1>Lessons & Goals 💡</h1>

  <p>
    I’ve learned it’s not about chasing money—it’s about growth. Real progress comes from slowing down, learning deeply, and staying consistent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every mistake, every bug, every stuck moment has shaped my journey more than tutorials ever could.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “It’s not how fast you learn, it’s how well you understand.” 🚀
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Now, my goal is to master <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, sharpen my <strong>UI/UX</strong> skills, and build real-world web and apps apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want to grow into a product-minded developer—someone who codes, designs, and helps others grow too.
  </p>
