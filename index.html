    I started this journey with curiosity, grew with passion, and now I’m building digital experiences that matter. 
    This is where I share my progress, my challenges, and everything I’ve learned along the way.

      <h1>How it Started 🙂</h1>
      <p>It all started a few years ago when I was searching for ways to overcome life’s struggles.</p>
      <p>Tech wasn't something I had dreamed of or was passionate about in the beginning.
         But today, it’s something I genuinely enjoy, something I never expected.</p>
      <p>To be honest, I initially joined the tech space with the mindset of making money as 
        quickly as possible. I didn’t realize I was giving myself false hope. I started 
        researching tech careers based on salary expectations, not personal interest or what
         I was naturally good at.</p>

      <h1>My Journey 😪</h1>

      <p>During my research in June 2023, I came across a bootcamp offering free
         tech training — KodeCamp. They had various tech fields to choose from, 
         so I joined the UI/UX Design track. That was where I learned my first 
         tech skill, got certified, and became confident in my abilities.</p>

      <p>Thanks to KodeCamp and the entire crew of the KodeCamp 3.0 cohort. At
         the time, I thought I had found the career with the best salary potential
         and the perfect fit for me. But I was still exploring. I had no clear
          roadmap and hadn’t yet discovered what I truly wanted to do in the tech world.</p>

      <div>

      </div>

      <p>I thought my UI/UX Design certificate was enough to thrive in the job 
        market, so I started applying for roles, but got no responses. With no
         clear direction, I felt discouraged and decided to explore other tech
          career paths.</p>

      <p>Along the line, I discovered Cisco NetAcad, where my cybersecurity journey
         began. I learned key concepts like firewalls, social engineering, MITM attacks,
          subnetting, and more eventually becoming a Cisco Certified Support Technician.
           That experience sparked my curiosity about how the internet and the web are 
        built, pushing me to explore further and apply my cybersecurity knowledge more effectively.</p>

      <h1>Front-end World 🤩</h1>
      <p>
        I started front-end development in November 2024 with a 40-hour self-paced HTML
         course from Cisco NetAcad.
        I rushed through HTML, CSS, and even jumped into JavaScript in days.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought I was ready to build 😎. But when it was time to code on my own, I opened 
        a blank editor with no idea where to start.
        I couldn’t even remember how to set up basic HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        It hit me hard... I wasn’t really learning, just copying tutorials. That was my wake-up call 💡.

  <h1>My Lessons 📘</h1>
  
  <p>
    The biggest lesson? Don’t chase tech for the money, chase <strong>growth</strong>.
    I learned that real progress isn’t about speed, it’s about understanding.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When I slowed down, focused on building solid skills, and stayed consistent,
    things started making sense. Whether in design, development, or cybersecurity,
    the journey rewards patience and commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s no shortcut just you, your screen, and the effort you put in daily. 
    From getting stuck on simple HTML to debugging JavaScript, every struggle taught me more than any tutorial ever could.
