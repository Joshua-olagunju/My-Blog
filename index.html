    I started this journey with curiosity, grew with passion, and now Iâ€™m building digital experiences that matter. 
    This is where I share my progress, my challenges, and everything Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

    <h1>How it Started ðŸ™‚</h1>
    <p>It all started a few years ago when I was searching for ways to overcome <br>
       lifeâ€™s struggles.</p>
    <p>Tech wasn't something I had dreamed of or was passionate about in the  <br>
       beginning. But today, itâ€™s something I genuinely enjoy, something I never expected.</p>
    <p>To be honest, I initially joined the tech space with the mindset of making <br>
       money as quickly as possible. I didnâ€™t realize I was giving myself false hope. <br>
       I started researching tech careers based on salary expectations, not personal <br>
       interest or what I was naturally good at.</p>

  <h1>My Journey ðŸ˜ª</h1>
    <p>During my research in June 2023, I came across a bootcamp offering <br>
       free tech training, KodeCamp. They had various tech fields to choose <br>
       from, so I joined the UI/UX Design track. That was where I learned my <br>
       first tech skill, got certified, and became confident in my abilities. </p>
    <p>Thanks to KodeCamp and the entire crew of the KodeCamp 3.0 cohort. <br>
       At the time, I thought I had found the career with the best salary <br>
       potential and the perfect fit for me. But I was still exploring. I had <br>
       no clear roadmap and hadnâ€™t yet discovered what I truly wanted to do <br>
       in the tech world.</p>

    <p>I thought my UI/UX Design certificate was enough to thrive in the <br>
       job market, so I started applying for roles, but got no responses. <br>
       With no clear roadmap, I felt discouraged and decided to explore <br>
       other tech career paths.</p>

    <p>Along the line, I discovered Cisco NetAcad, where my cybersecurity <br>
       journey began. I learned key concepts like firewalls, social engineering, <br>
       MITM attacks, subnetting, and more, eventually becoming a Cisco <br>
       Certified Support Technician. That experience sparked my curiosity <br>
       about how the internet and the web are built, pushing me to explore <br>
       further and apply my cybersecurity knowledge more effectively.</p>
